# HELP APPRECIATED ðŸ’•

Hello, World! My name is Albina and I'm learning to code.
I'm trying to make a nice website for volunteers from SIDOK (Students in development of Kyrgyzstan). Most volunteers are students from universities of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. I am a former volunteer and leader of this club.

At this moment I am trying to:

* Make a one-page landing page.
